Her research interests lie at the intersection of Operations Research, Epidemiology and Data Sciences. Her methodological expertise is in development and analysis of computer simulation models, and in particular the class of agent-based simulations, for study of disease epidemics in human populations. She has applied these models to study of HIV and TB epidemics, focusing on derivers of transmissions, confection of multiple infectious diseases, and patterns of aging and comorbidities among others. Calibrated against epidemiological data, these simulation models provide a powerful tool to explain the current trends in data, predict future trends under various assumptions and compare the impact of alternative interventions for prevention and control of disease. Dr. Kasaie is currently supported on a K01 career development grant from NIH focusing on studying the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Infections among Men who have Sex with Men in Baltimore City.
