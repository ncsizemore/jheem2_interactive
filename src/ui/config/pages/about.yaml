    overview:
      title: "Overview"
      content: "The JHEEM is a dynamic, compartmental model of HIV. We have calibrated the model to recapitulate the HIV Epidemic in 32 cities identified by the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative (EtE). In each of these cities, we can experiment with different levels of the EtE pillars - HIV testing, viral suppression among people with HIV (PWH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among individuals at risk for HIV - to project their effect on future transmission."

        caption: 
          - "The JHEEM represents the adult population (13 years old and older) as stratified into seven compartments with respect to HIV."
          - "The population is further stratified by age (13-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and â‰¥55 years old), race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, and other), sex/sexual behavior (female, heterosexual male, and MSM), and IV drug use (never use, active use, and prior use), for a total of 945 compartments across 135 strata of age, race, sex, and IV drug use."
    
    calibration:
      title: "Calibration"
      content: "The JHEEM includes 131 variable parameters. Running the model with one set of parameter values yields a simulation, which comprises simulated numbers of infections past and future."
